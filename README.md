# Adventure Game Project
A simple version of an old-fashioned text-based adventure game.  The game does the following:
- Gives the player a description of what is happening, and then asks them to make a choice.
- Something different happens depending on the choice the player makes.
- The game includes some random factors, so that it is a little different each time it is played.
- The game has conditions for winning and losing.
- When the game is over, it asks if the player wants to play again.
